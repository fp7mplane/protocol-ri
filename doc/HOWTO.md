# Demonstration and Example Component HOWTO

This document describes how to get started with the mPlane SDK, the included component runtime `mpcom`, the debugging client `mpcli`, and the demonstration supervisor `mpsup`. It presumes that the software is run from the root directory of a working copy of the https://github.com/fp7mplane/protocol-ri Git repository. The demonstration supervisor and the sample configuration files are *not* installed with the release SDK module.

## Run Supervisor, Component and Client

To start the demonstration Supervisor with the included sample configuration and certificates, change to the repository directory and run:

```scripts/mpsup --config ./conf/supervisor.conf```

To run the Component:

```scripts/mpcom --config ./conf/component.conf```

At this point, the Component will automatically register its capabilities to the Supervisor. Now launch the Client:

```mpcli --config ./conf/client.conf```

As soon as it's launched, the Client connects to the Supervisor and retrieves the capabilities. To get a list of commands available, type ```help```.
The minimum sequence of commands to run a capability and retrieve results is:

1. ```listcap``` will show all the available capabilities.
2. ```runcap <name_or_token>``` runs a capability from the ```listcap``` list. You will be asked to insert parameter values for that capability.
3. ```listmeas``` shows all pending receipts and received measures.
4. ```showmeas <name_or_token>``` shows the measure (or pending receipt) in detail.

While executing these operations, the supervisor and the component will print some status udate messages, giving information about the communications going on.

## Sample Configuration Files
Sample configuration files are located in ```protocol-ri/conf/``` in the mPlane GitHub repository. See [conf.md](conf.md) for an introduction to the mPlane SDK configuration file format.

# Testing and Developing the SDK

## Testing

Unit testing is done with the nose package. To run:

`nosetests --with-doctest mplane.model`

## Documentation

API documentation on [github](https://fp7mplane.github.io/protocol-ri) is autogenerated from Python docstrings with sphinx. Regenerating the documentation requires the sphinx package; once this is installed, use the following command from the sphinx directory to rebuild the documentation.

`PYTHONPATH=.. make html`
