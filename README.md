# mPlane Protocol Software Development Kit

This module contains the mPlane Software Development Kit.

The draft protocol specification is available in [doc/protocol-spec.md](https://github.com/fp7mplane/protocol-ri/blob/sdk/doc).

The mPlane Protocol provides control and data interchange for passive and active network measurement tasks. It is built around a simple workflow in which __Capabilities__ are published by __Components__, which can accept __Specifications__ for measurements based on these Capabilities, and provide __Results__, either inline or via an indirect export mechanism negotiated using the protocol.

Measurement statements are fundamentally based on schemas divided into Parameters, representing information required to run a measurement or query; and Result Columns, the information produced by the measurement or query. Measurement interoperability is provided at the element level; that is, measurements containing the same Parameters and Result Columns are considered to be of the same type and therefore comparable.

# Using the mPlane SDK

## Prerequisites

The mPlane SDK requires Python 3.3 and the following additional packages:

- pyyaml
- tornado
- urllib3

## Contents

The SDK is made up of several modules. The core classes are documented using Sphinx. Reasonably current Sphinx documentation can be read online [here](https://fp7mplane.github.io/protocol-ri).

- `mplane.model`: Information model and JSON representation of mPlane messages.
- `mplane.scheduler`: Component specification scheduler. Maps capabilities to Python code that implements them (in `Service`) and keeps track of running specifications and associated results (`Job` and `MultiJob`).
- `mplane.tls`: Handles TLS, mapping local and peer certificates to identities and providing TLS connectivity over HTTPS.
- `mplane.azn`: Handles access control, mapping identities to roles and authorizing roles to use specific services.
- `mplane.client`: mPlane client framework. Handles client-initiated (`HttpClient`) and component-initiated (`ListenerHttpClient`) workflows.

There are two scripts installed with the package, as well:

- `mpcli`: Simple client with command-line shell for debugging.
- `mpcom`: mPlane component runtime. Handles client-initiated and component-initiated workflows.

## mPlane SDK Configuration Files

The TLS state, access control, client framework, command-line client, and component runtime use a unified configuration file in Windows INI file format (as supported by the Python standard library `configparser` module).

The following sections and keys are supported/required by each module:

- `TLS` section: Certificate configuration. Required by component and client to support HTTPS URLs. Has the following keys:
    - `ca-chain`: path to file containing PEM-encoded certificates for the valid certificate authorities.
    - `cert`: path to file containing decoded and PEM-encoded certificate identifying this component/client. Must contain the decoded certificate as well, from which the distinguished name can be extracted.
    - `key`: path to file containing (decrypted) PEM-encoded secret key associated with this component/client's certificate
- `Roles` section: Maps identities to roles for access control. Used by component.py. Each key in this section is an mPlane identity (see below), and the value is a comma-separated list of arbitrary role names assigned to the identity.
- `Authorizations` section: Authorizes defined roles to invoke services associated with capabilities by capability label or token. Each key is a capability label or token, and the value is a comma-separated list of arbitrary role names which may invoke the capability. The use of labels is recommended for authorizations, as it makes authorization configuration more auditable. If authorizations are present, _only_ those capabilities which are explicitly authorized to a given client identity will be invocable.
- `Component` section: Global configuration for the component framework.
- `Client` section: Global configuration for the client framework.
- `ClientShell` section: Contains defaults for the mPlane client shell (see mPlane Client Shell below for details).

### Component Modules

In addition, any section in a configuration file given to component.py which begins with the substring `module_` will cause a component module to be loaded at runtime and that modules services to be made available (see Implementing a Component below). The `module` key in this section identifies the Python module to load by name. All other keys in this section are passed to the module's `services()` function as keyword arguments.

### Identities

Identities in the mPlane SDK (for purposes of configuration) are represented as a dot-separated list of elements of the Distinguished Name appearing in the certificate associated with the identity. So, for example, a certificate issued to `DC=ch, DC=ethz, DC=csg, OU=clients, CN=client-33` would be represented in the Roles section of a component configuration as `ch.ethz.csg.clients.client-33`.

## Implementing a Component

The component runtime provides a framework for building components for both component-initiated and client-initiated workflows. To implement a component for use with this framework:

- Implement each measurement, query, or other action performed by the component as a subclass of mplane.scheduler.Service. Each service is bound to a single capability. Your service must implement at least the mplane.scheduler.Service.run(self, specification, check_interrupt) method.

- Implement a `services` function in your module that takes a set of keyword arguments derived from the configuration file section, and returns a list of Services provided by your component. For example:

```python
def service(**kwargs):
    return [MyFirstService(kwargs['local-ip-address']),
            MySecondService(kwargs['local-ip-address'])]
```

- Create a module section in the component configuration file; for example if your module is called mplane.components.mycomponent:

```
[service_mycomponent]
module: mplane.components.mycomponent
local-ip-address: 10.2.3.4
```
**[*Editor's Note:* need to define how to configure component.py for each workflow.]**

- Run `mpcom` to start your component. The `--config` argument points to the configuration file to use.

## mPlane Client Shell

The mPlane Client Shell is a simple client intended for debugging of mPlane infrastructures. To start it, simply run `mpcli`. It supports the following commands:

- `seturl`: Set the default URL for sending specifications and redemptions (when not given in a Capability's or Receipt's link section)
- `getcap`: Retrieve capabilities and withdrawals from a given URL, and process them.
- `listcap`: List available capabilities
- `showcap`: Show the details of a capability given its label or token
- `when`: Set the temporal scope for a subsequent `runcap` command
- `set`: Set a default parameter value for a subsequent `runcap` command
- `unset`: Unset a previously set default parameter value
- `show`: Show a previously set default parameter value
- `runcap`: Run a capability given its label or token
- `listmeas`: List known measurements (receipts and results)
- `showmeas`: Show the details of a measurement given its label or token.
- `tbenable`: Enable tracebacks for subsequent exceptions. Used for client debugging.

# Testing and Developing the SDK

## Testing

Unit testing is done with the nose package. To run:

`nosetests --with-doctest mplane.model`

## Documentation

API documentation on [github](https://fp7mplane.github.io/protocol-ri) is autogenerated from Python docstrings with sphinx. Regenerating the documentation requires the sphinx package; once this is installed, use the following command from the sphinx directory to rebuild the documentation.

`PYTHONPATH=.. make html`
